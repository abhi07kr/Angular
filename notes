angular application architecture


Module : a collection of multiple related components
	e.g: A order module can consist of 2 components
		a) A shipping address component
		b) payments component
	

Components: a component is the smallest independent unit of an angular app that serves
		one purpose inside the app


MVC architecture



Every component in angular has 4 files


1) <component-name>.component.ts: logic for component's functionality
2) <component-name>.component.html : view part of the component goes here!
3) <component-name>.component.css : styling for the component goes here. COMPONENT SPECIFIC
4) <component-name>.component.spec.ts : write unit tests for this component here

app.component -------------> customer-component














STYLE BINDING



1) user goes to the web browser.
	a) app component gets rendered
	b) control gets transferred to app-customer(because we wrote this tag in app.component.html)
	c) customer component gets rendered
	d) upon clicking the button, style of paragraph tag should change from style2 to style1(css classes)
